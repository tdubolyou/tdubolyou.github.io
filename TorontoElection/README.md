We used Arc to spatially join the ward subdivisions and the dissemination areas, then imported all the data to MS Access for integration.  We used SPSS to do some regression analysis and pick the variables that had a significant impact.  Once we had that final dataset i joined it back to the ward subdivision shapefile.  We used QGIS to export it to a geoJSON file, and then created the visualization using <a href="http://d3js.org">d3.js</a>.
